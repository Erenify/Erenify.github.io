        <h3>Building Your First Python GUI Application With Tkinter</h3>
        <p>
            The foundational element of a Tkinter GUI is the window. Windows are the containers in which all other GUI
            elements live. These other GUI elements, such as text boxes, labels, and buttons, are known as widgets.
            Widgets are contained inside of windows.

        <h3>Working With Widgets</h3>
        <p>
            Widgets are the bread and butter of the Python GUI framework Tkinter. They are the elements through which
            users interact with your program. Each widget in Tkinter is defined by a class.
